# 🔬 Lab Ideas for Session 6: Continuous-Time Modeling and Complex Temporal Structures

## Lab 6.1: Handling Irregularly Sampled Data
- **Task:** Take a dataset with irregular timestamps and preprocess it for deep learning models.  
- **Focus:** Compare simple imputation approaches (forward/backward fill, interpolation) vs. neural models that directly handle irregular time steps.  
- **Advanced Twist:** Evaluate performance differences for forecasting short-term vs. long-term horizons and analyze sensitivity to sampling sparsity.

## Lab 6.2: Neural ODEs for Time Series Forecasting
- **Task:** Implement a Neural ODE model for continuous-time forecasting.  
- **Focus:** Learn how to model dynamics without discretizing time explicitly.  
- **Advanced Twist:** Compare Neural ODEs against RNNs/Transformers on irregularly sampled sequences. Visualize learned continuous trajectories and assess stability under extrapolation.

## Lab 6.3: Implicit Neural Representations for Continuous-Time Sequences
- **Task:** Implement implicit neural representations (INRs) for time series, e.g., using SIREN or Fourier feature networks.  
- **Focus:** Represent the sequence as a continuous function of time, allowing predictions at arbitrary timestamps.  
- **Advanced Twist:** Compare INRs with Neural ODEs and RNNs on irregularly sampled datasets. Visualize learned functions and test generalization to unseen time intervals.

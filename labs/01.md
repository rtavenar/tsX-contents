# 🔬 Lab Ideas for Session 1: Foundations of Time Series Modeling with Deep Learning

## Lab 1.1: Exploring Temporal Dependencies
- **Task:** Compare naïve baselines (last value, seasonal naïve) with simple neural network models (MLP, shallow RNN) on a real-world dataset (e.g., electricity consumption or stock prices).  
- **Focus:** Highlight how temporal dependencies are (or are not) captured in different approaches.  
- **Advanced Twist:** Visualize autocorrelation plots, partial autocorrelation, and learned feature importance to analyze whether the neural model actually captures temporal structure.

## Lab 1.2: Seasonality and Detrending with Deep Models
- **Task:** Implement preprocessing pipelines to explicitly remove seasonality/trend (via STL decomposition or differencing) vs. letting the neural model learn them implicitly.  
- **Focus:** Compare forecasting performance between models trained with raw vs. detrended data.  
- **Advanced Twist:** Test whether deep networks can re-learn seasonality from scratch if it’s stripped out — probing representational capacity.

## Lab 1.3: Evaluation Metrics for Forecasting
- **Task:** Implement and compare multiple metrics (MAE, RMSE, MASE, sMAPE, ~~CRPS for probabilistic forecasts~~).  
- **Focus:** Highlight how metric choice changes model rankings.  
- **Advanced Twist:** Design **adversarial examples** (e.g., constant series, series with outliers, intermittent demand) and see how different metrics behave — which metrics are robust vs. misleading.

## Lab 1.4: Loss Functions for Time Series
- **Task:** Implement different loss functions commonly used in time series forecasting:  
  - MSE / MAE  
  - ~~Quantile loss (pinball loss)~~
  - ~~Huber loss~~
  - ~~Custom weighted losses for multivariate forecasting~~
  - softDTW and variants
- **Focus:** Train the same model with different losses and compare predictive behavior.  
- **Advanced Twist:** Explore **distribution shift robustness** — e.g., train with MSE on stationary training data and test on data with seasonal drift. How does choice of loss affect adaptability?

## Lab 1.5: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
- **Task:** Implement a baseline multivariate forecasting model (e.g., MLP or shallow RNN) using a dataset with correlated signals (e.g., traffic or weather).  
- **Focus:** Visualize learned inter-variable dependencies.  
- **Advanced Twist:** Compare performance between models trained with full multivariate input vs. only univariate target variable input.
